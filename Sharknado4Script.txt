Jim: Man it sure is cloudy today. That water looks pretty cold and ominous.

Sarah: I agree.
Jim: Want to go for a swim?

Sarah: Sure!
*They both run across the beach and jump in to the water

Jim: Wow this water is freezing!

Sarah: We just have to keep swimming further out to stay warm!

*Suddenly, a shark jumps out of the water in front them

Jim: AHHHHHHHHHH

Jim: AHHHHHHH
Sarah: AHHH
Shark: What?
Shark: Muahahahaha

Shark: Why are you all so scared?

Jim: woohooo
Sarah: Oh no!
